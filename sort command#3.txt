#You are given a text file where each line contains a number. The numbers may be either an integer or have decimal places. There #will be no extra characters other than the number or the newline at the end of each line. Sort the lines in ascending order - so #that the first line holds the numerically smallest number, and the last line holds the numerically largest number.
